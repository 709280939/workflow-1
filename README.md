First Flow
----------

This is HelloWorld example how to use Neuro4j Flows.

Flow file org\neuro4j\example\HelloWorld.n4j:

![workflow-example-higlevel](https://raw.github.com/neuro4j/workflow/master/doc/images/HelloWorld.png "HelloWorld workflow")


HelloWorld.java

![workflow-example-higlevel](https://raw.github.com/neuro4j/workflow/1.3.0/doc/images/HelloWorldCustomBlock.png "HelloWorld workflow")

Following code execute flow:
